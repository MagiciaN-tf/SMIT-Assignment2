    <h1>The Adventure in the Forest</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
      John had been gazing out of his cabin window for about an hour now. On his
      table, amidst the maps, compasses, and survival guides, was a well-worn
      copy of <cite>The Lost Expedition</cite>. It had been John's favorite book
      since his days in the military, and the longer he spent in the dense
      forest, the more he felt the need to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spent the last ten years in this wilderness, sitting under a banner
      with a quote from an ancient explorer that declared
      <q>Adventure is worthwhile in itself</q>. Despite many recognizing his
      feats in discovering rare species and mapping uncharted territories, John
      <strong>did</strong> believe he had more exciting adventures to embark
      upon.
